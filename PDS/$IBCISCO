   IBM/Cisco Interoperability



   We have successfully been using IBM 2212 routers for a couple
   of years. The routers are used to connect branch offices to
   the headquarters providing both IP and SNA connectivity using
   DLSw.

   DLSw is used to connect remote Ethernet attached Microsoft SNA
   servers and SDLC attached 3174 communications controllers.

   With the withdrawal from marketing of the IBM routers, Cisco
   routers are now the order of the day.

   While there is now an excellent IBM Redbook (SG24-5865 IBM
   Router Interoperability and Migration Examples) on the
   subject, the examples given, especially for DLSw were too
   complex for our needs.

   In this document, a Cisco router configuration that provides
   for both IP and DLSw connectivity to a central 2212 router is
   described. It is assumed that the reader is conversant with
   the IBM 2212 series configuration.

   Note: This was my first exposure to a Cisco router and I had
   two days to get it working.


   dlsw local-peer peer-id 10.20.255.1
   dlsw remote-peer 0 tcp 10.1.0.29
   dlsw bridge-group 1
   bridge 1 protocol ieee

   These global statements are used to define the local and
   remote DLSw peers and to enable bridging, giving a bridge
   group number.

   The local-peer statement defines the IP address that is to be
   used as the local DLSw peer. For 2212 routers this would be
   the internal IP address. Cisco routers do not have an Internal
   IP address, so we must use another IP address. The address
   used can be any IP address that has been defined on an
   interface. So, for example, we could use the IP address
   defined for the Ethernet interface. However, this would mean
   that DLSw would only work when the Ethernet interface was
   active - This may not always be true. A solution is to define
   a loopback interface and use its IP address for the local-peer
   id. A loopback interface is always active. The only
   complication is that the IP address for the loopback interface
   must be in a unique subnet - that is we can't use the same
   subnet as the Ethernet interface (like we can for the internal
   2212 IP address). The convention we used is to take the
   Ethernet network, in this case 10.20.0 and make the last
   number 255 and use a host address of 1. This makes the
   loopback address 10.20.255.1. Another option is to use the IP
   address of the serial connection, in our case 10.240.11.2.

   The remote-peer statement defines the id of the remote peer
   (the 2212) and what protocol should be used to transfer the
   DLSw packets. For connection to a non Cisco box, we can only
   use TCP. The IP address given is the internal IP address of
   the central 2212 in this example 10.1.0.29

   Finally, to activate DLSw on a LAN interface (Ethernet or
   Token Ring), we must enable bridging (on the 2212 we do this
   by enabling ASRT). We give the bridge group a number, which we
   will use later.  Note that if we only wanted to provide DLSw
   to serial attached devices, such as a 3174, we would not need
   to activate bridging.

   Warning When you turn on bridging, the IOS makes the
   assumption that you don't want routing and turns it off (with
   a no ip routing statement), you need to turn it back on (ip
   routing).

   If you want to restrict traffic to SNA and not send Netbios
   packets there are various ways to do this. One way is to
   filter by SAP. First create an access list:

   access-list 200 permit 0x0000 0x0d0d

   Then reference the list from the dlsw remote-peer statement:

   dlsw remote-peer 0 tcp 10.1.0.29 lsap-output-list 200

   interface Loopback0
   ip address 10.20.255.1 255.255.255.255

   These statements enable a loopback interface and assign an IP
   address for use as the DLSw local peer - note the mask of
   255.255.255.255

   Interface Ethernet0/0
   ip address 10.20.0.30 255.255.255.0
   ip helper-address 10.1.0.5
   no ip mroute-cache
   bridge-group 1

   These statements define the Ethernet interface. The 'no ip
   mroute-cache' was added by IOS. The bridge-group statement
   defines the bridge group that this interface belongs to. This
   should match the group defined above for DLSw. If you are not
   using DLSw on the Ethernet interface, you will not need this.

   The ip helper-address statement defines the address of a
   server where broadcast packets are to be forwarded. The global
   forward-protocol statement is used to define what packets are
   forwarded. In our case we want to forward bootp packets to the
   backup dhcp server running on the mainframe at the central
   site.

   Note:the default is to forward a number of UDP packets,
   including netbios, dns and bootp. To only forward bootp
   packets, we have to specify the port numbers we don't want
   forwarded by using 'no forward-protocol statements'. See the
   full configuration for details.

   interface serial0/0
   mtu 2048
   ip address 10.240.11.2 255.255.255.0
   encapsulation ppp
   ip tcp header-compression
   no ip mroute-cache

   These statements define the serial interface that connects to
   the central 2212 router. Note that this router has a two port
   serial module with serial interfaces serial0/0 and serial0/1.

   The MTU statement is required to make the MTU (Maximum
   Transmission Unit) match that of the 2212. The Cisco default
   is 1500, while the 2212 defaults to 2048. (Note: When I
   displayed the PPP MTU in use from the 2212 it was 1500 - go
   figure).

   By default, Cisco routers use the HDLC protocol, with some
   Cisco specific protocol changes. To talk to a non Cisco
   router, such as a 2212, we must use PPP and not HDLC. The
   encapsulation statement changes the protocol to PPP.

   To improve performance, we have requested that the IP header
   be compressed. On slow connections, we could also use packet
   compression (compress stac).

   interface serial0/1
   mtu 4400
   no ip address
   encapsulation sdlc
   no ip mroute-cache
   no keepalive
   nrzi-encoding
   clockrate 19200
   sdlc role primary
   sdlc vmac 4000.3174.2000
   sdlc address C1
   sdlc sdlc-largest-frame C1 521
   sdlc xid c1 05d20010
   sdlc partner 0800.5a8b.0761 c1
   sdlc dlsw c1

   These statements define the serial interface that is used to
   connect a 3174 using SDLC. The MTU statement is used to set
   the MTU size required (this was taken from the IBM red book).

   nrzi-encoding is used to change from the default of nrz
   encoding. This should match the option used when the 3174 was
   customized.

   The clockrate statement is used to specify the speed that we
   will connect to the 3174 with. This value depends on the cable
   used to connect the 3174. For RS-232, 19200 is the maximum.
   For V35, 64000 could be used. Note that for the Cisco, we
   don't have to define the cable type as we do for the 2212,
   this is discovered automatically by the smart serial module.

   The various SDLC statements are used to define SDLC specific
   information, and DLSw related details. Most are self
   explanatory and have a direct relation to the set link
   commands used on the 2212.

   The sdlc vmac statement (sdlc vmac 4000.3174.2000) defines the
   virtual mac address that will be used by DLSw to connect to
   the central site. We have used a naming convention of 3174
   followed by the IP subnet number 20. The final 00 will be
   changed by the IOS software to match the SDLC address of the
   connecting 3174. This will result in a mac address of
   4000317420C1. Just be sure to pick an address that is not used
   anywhere else on the network.

   The sdlc xid statement (sdlc xid C1 05D20010) defines the XID
   idnum and idblk to be used by the specified SDLC address
   (C1).These values must match those specified in the VTAM
   switched network major node.

   The sdlc partner statement defines the target mac address. In
   this case, the address of the OSA (Open Systems Adapter) port
   on the mainframe.



   ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.240.11.1

   Because we are not using a dynamic routing protocol (such as
   OSPF) we must define a default route. This sets the default
   route to the matching 2212 serial port.



   IBM 2212 Configuration Differences

   When the remote end of a connection is a Cisco router, rather
   than another 2212, we must make a few changes to the way we
   define the connection.

        We must define two static routes. One for the Cisco
        Ethernet subnet (in this example 10.20.0/24) and one for
        the Cisco loopback address for DLSw (in this example
        10.20.255/24):

        add route 10.20.0.0 255.255.255.0 1
        add route 10.20.255.0 255.255.255.0 1

        We should not enable OSPF on the serial port. For 2212 to
        2212 DLSw sessions, OSPF is required to support dynamic
        peers.



   Putting it All Together

   Finally, putting all of the above considerations together, we
   come up with a complete configuration.

   Below is the complete listing of the configuration for the
   Cisco 2610 router. While it should not be considered the
   definitive solution, it has been successfully implemented on
   our network.
