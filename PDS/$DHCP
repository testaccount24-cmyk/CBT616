    DHCP on the Mainframe

    ---------------------------------------------------------

    I have been running DHCP server on a Windows NT server
    for a year or so. However, despite being generally
    reliable, the server required  re-booting too often for
    my liking. With the installation of OS/390 2.9 on our
    mainframe, I decided to migrate to the DHCP server that
    came along with Communications Server.

    My purpose was twofold. First, of all the servers in our
    shop, the mainframe remains the most reliable. Second,
    it was an opportunity to start consolidating the many NT
    servers to one platform - OS/390.

    The installation was done in two phases. In phase one,
    DHCP was configured to support the local subnet. In
    phase two it would be expanded to provide backup for all
    the remote subnets. A possible third phase would be to
    implement dynamic DNS.

    Although the documentation is somewhat sparse, I managed
    to come up with an initial configuration file for phase
    one:

         numLogFiles 4
         logFileSize 400
         logFileName /tmp/dhcpsd.log
         logItem SYSERR
         logItem OBJERR
         logItem PROTERR
         logItem WARNING
         logItem EVENT
         logItem ACTION
         logItem INFO
         leaseTimeDefault 3 days
         leaseExpireInterval 10 minutes
         supportBOOTP No
         SupportUnlistedClients Yes

         #
         # Subnet 10.1 - Main Data Centre
         #

         subnet 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0
         10.1.0.100-10.1.0.255
         {
         option 1 255.255.0.0        # Mask
         option 3 10.1.0.30          # Router
         option 6 10.1.0.20          # DNS
         option 15 mycentre.org.om   # Domain Name
         }

    The configuration file was saved as /etc/dhcpsd.cfg and
    the DHCP server was executed as a started task using the
    sample JCL (DHCP in TCPIP.SEZAINST).

    After running the server for a few days, I had made a
    number of observations about the product:

       * Considering the size of our local LAN, about 100
         devices, the DHCPSD address space appeared to
         consume excessive resources, both EXCPs and CPU
         time
       * The log file contained many cryptic and
         undocumented messages
       * Windows users were unable to renew a lease with
         ipconfig /renew. A reboot was required
       * ipconfig /release launched an unexpected address
         space.

    Excessive EXCPS

    With such a small LAN, an EXCP count of about 100,000 a
    day seemed somewhat excessive. When I reported this to
    IBM they came up with the following suggestion:

       * Use Smart Caching. This is an undocumented feature
         which when enabled will cause DHCP to only write
         its files during garbage collection which is run
         every "leaseExpireInterval". Smart Caching is
         enabled by creating a file /etc/dhcp_sc The
         contents of the file do not matter.

    In addition to this change, I also increased
    LeaseExpireInterval to 60 minutes and set
    StatisticSnapshot to 8. This creates statistics every 8
    hours (LeaseExpireInterval x 8).

    Excessive CPU

    I felt that for such a small network, DHCP was consuming
    too much CPU. In my case, more than NetView. The main
    reason for this is that the DHCP address space seems to
    consume CPU at a steady rate even if no requests are
    coming in. In my case a constant half to one percent.
    Although I reported this to IBM, I never got an
    explanation of why it worked this way.

    Cryptic Messages

    Depending on what LogItem commands are contained in the
    configuration file, the server can log many messages.
    Most are simply documenting the flow of requests and
    responses and can be ignored. Some of the messages I was
    getting however seemed to indicate a problem.

    Unfortunately, the messages don't have message numbers,
    not unusual in Unix perhaps, but an anathema to MVS
    sysprogs.

    I won't detail all the messages here, but despite a long
    and sometimes painful correspondence with IBM support, I
    never got a satisfactory explanation of what the
    messages meant and why I was getting them.

    For example, what does the following message indicate. I
    suspect it may be security related (we run ACF2):

         PROTERR: addArpEntry, SIOCSARP ioctl failed
         (117)

    IPCONFIG /RENEW Problem

    This problem occurred spasmodically  on workstations
    running Windows. If the command ipconfig /renew was
    issued the following error message appeared:

         IP Configuration Error DHCP Server
         Unavailable: Renewing adapter

    Despite sending console logs and traces of this problem
    to IBM, it was never resolved. The only suggestion was
    that it should be followed up with Microsoft.

    IPCONFIG /RELEASE Problem

    When the command ipconfig /release was issued from a
    Windows PC a new address space was created running the
    command 'nsupdate -b'.  This address space entered a
    wait state and the following message was logged by the
    DHCP server:

    WARNING:  do_nsupdate_packet: something went wrong in
    starting nsupdate

    This too was reported to IBM. Their response 'nsupdate
    -b is only used internally by DHCP therefore it is not
    documented' - well, thanks, very helpful.

    Phase Two

    Despite these problems, I pressed on with phase two.
    This meant adding a separate subnet for each remote
    network and configuring the routers to forward bootp
    packets to OS/390. The final configuration file now
    looked like this:

    numLogFiles 4
    logFileSize 400
    logFileName /tmp/dhcpsd.log
    logItem SYSERR
    logItem OBJERR
    logItem PROTERR
    logItem WARNING
    logItem EVENT
    logItem ACTION
    logItem INFO
    leaseTimeDefault 3 days
    leaseExpireInterval 60 minutes
    StatisticSnapshot 8
    supportBOOTP No
    SupportUnlistedClients Yes

    #
    # Subnet 10.1 - Main Data Centre
    #

    subnet 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.1.0.100-10.1.0.255
    {
    option 1 255.255.0.0        # Mask
    option 3 10.1.0.30          # Router
    option 6 10.1.0.20          # DNS
    option 15 mycentre.org.om   # Domain Name
    }
    #
    # Subnet 10.3.0 - Remote location 1
    #

    subnet 10.3.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.3.0.100-10.3.0.150
    {
    option 1 255.255.255.0   # Mask
    option 3 10.3.0.30       # Router
    }

    #
    # Subnet 10.4.0 - Remote Location 2
    #

    subnet 10.4.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.4.0.100-10.4.0.150
    {
    option 1 255.255.255.0   # Mask
    option 3 10.4.0.30       # Router
    }

    # More subnets left out for brevity

    Final Thoughts

    Despite the many unexplained and continuing problems
    with DHCP on the mainframe, I have  stuck with it and at
    the time of writing we are running in production mode.

     However it is likely that as soon as we have migrated
    our NT servers to Windows 2000, we will move the DHCP
    server back to Windows. There have just been to many
    problems and below par support from IBM to continue
    running the server on the mainframe.
