   S/390 Corner

   ----------------------------------------------------------
   I currently make my living supporting, among other
   things, IBM S/390 computer systems. This page contains
   some items that might be of use to others in this
   field, if only of historic interest.

   DHCP on the Mainframe

   I have recently moved our DHCP server from Windows NT to
   the mainframe. My experiences, good and bad can be found
   here.

   IBM/Cisco Router Interoperability - An Example

   I have recently had to integrate Cisco routers into an
   all IBM network including IBM 2212 routers. This document
   describes the Cisco configuration file used to provide IP
   and SNA connectivity between a Cisco 2610 and an IBM
   2212.

   Software

   OS/390     IEFUSI is an SMF exit used to override the
              region size for a job step. This version
              while specific to a particular sites needs,
              may be useful as a starting point for
              writing your own.

              Get zipped source code
              RACFXREF is a program to produce a cross
              reference of rules used by userids and
              groups. A list of rules for which there is
              no matching group or user is also
              displayed. This program was knocked up in a
              hurry, and it shows ! My current shop uses
              ACF2 so I have not tested it recently. If
              nothing else, it is an example of how to
              use the ICHEINTY macro.

              ROPMONT

              This program alerts the system operator
              when one or more address spaces are not
              running. While it may not be useful in your
              environment, it serves as a good example of
              how a program can respond to Modify and
              Stop commands using the QEDIT macro.

              GENOAT

              Genoat is a Rexx program that is used to
              generate an OAT (OSA Address Table)
              required to configure an Open Systems
              Adapter. Along with the Rexx source is
              sample input and output.

   CICS Stuff ISSIGN is a CICS signon program. This
              program was originally written to replace
              the then, very limited IBM supplied
              program. It was last tested under CICS
              Version 4.1
